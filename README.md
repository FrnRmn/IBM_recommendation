### Motivation
The current work is a project proposed by Udacity in collaboration with [IBM Watson](https://www.ibm.com/watson).

In this notebook I analyze the interactions between users and articles of the IBM Watson Studio platform.
The goal is to build a recommendation system, to suggest users some articles they might like.


### Notebook Structure
1. Data loading and preparation
2. Exploratory analysis
3. Rank based recommendation
4. User-based collaborative filtering
5. Matrix factorization


### Credits
Anonymized real world data were made available by [IBM Watson](https://www.ibm.com/watson).
